        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome!</p>
        <p>A little about myself:</p>
        <p>
          I am one of the few native Floridians that exist in the world. I am originally from Miami, but have lived in Southwest Florida for quite some time. My family is originally from Cuba, so I am fluent in Spanish. I also can understand and carry light converstations in French. My favorite foods are Cuban, naturally, and Middle Eastern food. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Professionally, I have been a software engineer for a little over a year. My main focus was with full-stack web development, but my strength was more with UI development with some back-end and sprinkled in. Currently, I am focusing more on back-end development dealing more with data and less with web development.
